# E-commerse-sales-analysis-with-python
Analyze e-commerce sales data to uncover trends, evaluate category and segment performance, and derive insights for business optimization. Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. Includes sales trends, category profit analysis, and segment insights. Ideal for strategy improvements and forecasting.

This project is a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales data aimed at identifying trends, evaluating performance, and deriving actionable business insights. It utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

# Key Objectives:
Understand monthly sales trends and seasonal patterns.
Analyze sales and profit performance across categories and sub-categories.
Evaluate customer segments to identify high-value opportunities.
Derive actionable recommendations for business optimization.
# Dataset:
The dataset (Sample - Superstore.csv) includes attributes like Order Date, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, and Segment. These were cleaned, processed, and enriched with additional time-based features like Order Month, Year, and Day of the Week.

# Methodology:
Data Cleaning: Checked and handled missing values, and converted date columns into usable formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generated descriptive statistics, visualized key trends, and grouped data for in-depth analysis.
Insights: Provided actionable insights after every analysis, focusing on high-performing categories and customer segments.
Visualizations:
The project includes insightful charts and graphs, such as:

# Monthly sales and profit trends using line plots.
Sales and profit breakdowns by category and sub-category using bar charts and pie charts.
Comparative analysis of customer segments, including sales-to-profit ratios.

# Tools and Techniques:
Python: For analysis and manipulation.
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn: For data handling and visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: Development and presentation environment.
# Key Outcomes:
Seasonal trends indicate months with high revenue potential.
High-sales categories may not always yield high profitability.
